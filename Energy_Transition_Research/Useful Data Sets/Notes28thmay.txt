Tasks:
1. Collect all 24 social datasets.
- Done but not everything is district wise

2. Employment of female agricultural workers / Total female population
Done, state-wise only

3. Employment of female SC / Total female SC population
Done, state & district wise

4. 5-14 SC workers / Total SC workers
For all population, we have age wise data for specific jobs (agriculture, industry, etc)
For SC specifically, only subdivisions are: main workers, marginal workers, non-workers
and non-workers seeking employment (unemployed)

5. What can and cannot be done with available data:
- Analyze SC literacy & SC employment inequalities state wise (comparing to total pop)
- Analyze employment of women, children, SC women & SC children state wise
- Analyze land-ownership of some specific SC castes

Assumptions:
1. Total workers = 
main workers + marginal workers for < 3 months + marginal workers for 3-6 months.

2. Agricultural workers = agricultural labourers + cultivators

Things to do next:
1. All data is scattered throughout multiple excel sheets, needs to be compiled and formatted
before modelling (should be one of the next tasks).
Let's have a deadline for 31st/1st to send a complete package.

Additional things we have: 
1. Muslim agricultural workers (age wise & state wise)
