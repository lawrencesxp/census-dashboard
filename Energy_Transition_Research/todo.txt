> find meaning of some of the interesting data points

social

1. i have state & district level data on demographics for all pop (can make gender, literacy & unemployement ratios)
2. i have state & district level data on demographics of SC & ST (can make gender, literacy & unemployement ratios)

sc & st gender, work & non-work, literacy proportions vs state or national level proportions
i can make the same ratios combining 1 & 2 like: literacy of SCs in district vs state level literacy of all pop


geography
i have district level land use data
i will likely get district level data on climate and rainfall
other than land use per capita, how should this be used?

> top 2 most populated SC and ST caste & tribe | 5 uniform castes that are marginalized across all states


this can be found but only population details of individual tribe exists state and district wise
so how should this be used?
